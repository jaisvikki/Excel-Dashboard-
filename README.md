ðŸš¦ðŸ“Š Introducing Road Accident Dashboard for 2021 and 2022 ðŸš—ðŸ’¥

I am excited to share with you the Road Accident Dashboard that I have created, showcasing insightful data on road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive view of various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accident casualties, vehicle types, road types, and more. Let's dive in!



Primary KPI - Total Casualties: One of the primary KPIs in focus is the total number of casualties after the accidents. This metric gives a clear understanding of the overall impact and severity of accidents.

Primary KPI - Total Casualties in Percentage: To comprehend the gravity of accidents, the dashboard presents the percentage of total casualties based on accident severity. This information helps identify accident scenarios that result in the most significant casualties.

Primary KPI - Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type: Another crucial metric displayed in the dashboard is the vehicle type associated with the maximum casualties. By understanding which type of vehicle is involved in the highest number of accidents, we can pinpoint areas for improvement and targeted safety measures.



Secondary KPI - Total Casualties by Vehicle Type: An insightful trend analysis is provided by comparing the total casualties based on vehicle type for the current year and the previous year. This allows us to track patterns, identify potential areas of concern, and measure progress in accident prevention.

Secondary KPI - Maximum Casualties by Road Type: The dashboard highlights the road types that have experienced the highest number of casualties. By identifying the road types with the most significant impact, agencies can take necessary actions to improve safety measures and reduce accidents.

Secondary KPI - Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface: Understanding the relationship between casualties and road surface is crucial for accident prevention strategies. The dashboard provides valuable insights into how casualties are distributed across different road surfaces, enabling informed decision-making for road maintenance and safety protocols.

Secondary KPI - Casualties by Area, Time of Day, and Lighting Conditions: Exploring the relationship between casualties and location, time of day, and lighting conditions allows us to identify high-risk areas and times. By focusing on reducing accidents during specific periods or in specific areas, targeted interventions can be devised.

I hope that this Road Accident Dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders involved in road safety. Together, let's work towards creating safer roads and preventing accidents.

Note: The data used for this dashboard is from reliable sources and represents the accidents reported during the mentioned years.
